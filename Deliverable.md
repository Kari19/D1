# Background: Emergency Services in South African Communities

South Africa is a country with both busy cities and large informal settlements, each
facing different challenges when it comes to getting emergency help. In big cities like
Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban, emergency services are often overloaded with
calls due to high crime rates and large populations. This leads to delays in response
times, and communities are left waiting for help in critical situations, like accidents or
medical emergencies.

But the real problem is in informal settlements and rural areas. These places often don’t
have proper roads or addresses, making it difficult for emergency services to find
people in need of help. In areas like Khayelitsha and Alexandra, people can wait a long
time for help to arrive, sometimes facing life-threatening delays.

South Africa has a centralized emergency system, where calls are answered by a
national call center and then sent to local responders. However, this system is often
slow because of the large number of calls it gets. In 2020, 40% of calls were abandoned
because of long wait times. Another big issue is that many areas don’t have clear street
names or recognizable landmarks, so emergency operators can’t always find the exact
location of the emergency. Also many people often do not know how to properly direct the authorities, this could be due to panic induced stress or simply a lack of the skill of giving directions.

Another big challenge is when firefighters are called to a fire using the current system of calling, is that they do not have a clear picture of the fire and can not correctly grade it to bring the correct vehicle for that certain size of fire. This often creates a delay.

Ambulance services also face serious challenges, especially in informal settlements
and rural areas. These communities often have no access to private vehicles that could
quickly transport someone to a hospital in an emergency. Community members can’t
always help each other, especially when a fast ambulance response is needed. Without
clear communication or awareness of the urgency, people might not realize that an
ambulance or car is needed quickly, and local volunteers can't step in to help in time.
Without this knowledge, they can't offer their own vehicles or assistance to help
someone get to the hospital fast, which makes medical emergencies even more
dangerous. With limited ambulance resources, delays in response are common, and
lives are at risk as a result.

In addition there is acceptance of petty crime and break-ins in communities which many accept due to their police not responding fast enough or the process of reporting being long and strainous. This leads to many giving up on trying to involve law enforcement. Fortunately in certain communities all over South Africa, there have been neighbourhood watches, volunteer patrols and community groups to fill the gap when law enforcement does not quickly respond. Unfortunately with this system it is dependant on hersay or via informal means of communication such as Instant messaging apps or social media, which does not guarantee that everyone living in the community will receive and see this SOS at the same time. Others can miss these messages due to already receiving many messages on that platform and missing it with all the junk mail. And at times, the community members fail to notify authorities which could lead to them solving emergencies which they are not trained to solve and could cause more injuries.
